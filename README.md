this folder stores two type of models (mean field and TPD) that incorporate adsorabte interaction with the combination of Monte Carlo simulation and machine learning algorithm

## required packages
LatticeMC
caslearn

## structure of the project folder

1. BCC-1NN-MF
	mean field model incorporate fix adsorbate interaction energy
2. BCC-1NN-TPD
	TPD model incorporate varied adsorbate interaction energies
